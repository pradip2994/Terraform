# Terraform

Terraform is an infrastructure as code (IaC) tool that allows you to create, manage, and update infrastructure resources such as virtual machines, networks, and storage in a repeatable, scalable, and automated way.

## What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure using code instead of manual processes. By treating infrastructure as code, teams can version control their infrastructure, automate the provisioning process, and improve collaboration between different teams. IaC enables teams to make changes to infrastructure in a safe and repeatable way, and it helps to reduce the risk of human error and inconsistencies.

## Why do we use terraform?

Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure in a safe, repeatable way. It enables teams to manage infrastructure as code, providing a single source of truth for the infrastructure and ensuring that it is always in the desired state. Terraform can be used to manage infrastructure across multiple cloud providers and on-premises infrastructure, and it supports a wide range of resource types.

## What is a Resource?

In Terraform, a resource is a declarative representation of a component in a cloud infrastructure, such as a virtual machine, database, or network interface. Resources define the desired state of the component, and Terraform uses the resource definition to create, modify, or delete the component as needed.

## What is a Provider?

In Terraform, a provider is a plugin that interfaces with a specific cloud infrastructure provider or service. Providers define the resources that Terraform can manage, as well as the methods for creating, updating, and deleting those resources. Examples of providers include AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure.

## What is the State file in terraform? Whatâ€™s the importance of it ?

The Terraform state file is a JSON file that stores the state of the infrastructure managed by Terraform. It includes information about the resources that have been created, their current state, and any dependencies between them. The state file is critical to Terraform's operation, as it is used to plan and execute changes to the infrastructure. The state file should be kept in a safe and secure location, as it contains sensitive information about the infrastructure.

## What is Desired and Current State?

In Terraform, the desired state is the state that you want your infrastructure to be in, as defined in your Terraform configuration files. The current state is the actual state of the infrastructure, as represented in the Terraform state file. When you run terraform apply, Terraform compares the desired state with the current state and makes changes as needed to bring the infrastructure into the desired state.

1) Terraform is an open source project created by HashiCorp and written in Go programming language.
2) Terraform is an infrastructure as a code software tool.
3) Infrastructure as a code is the process of managing infrastructure in a file or files rather than manually configuring resources in a user interface (UI).
4) In Terraform resources are nothing but virtual machines, Elastic IP, Security Group, Network interfaces.
5) Terraform Code is written in the Hashicorp Configuration Language (HCL) in files with the extension .tf 
6) Terraform allows users to use Hashicorp Configuration Language (HCL) to create the files containing definitions of their desired resources.
7) Terraform Supports almost all cloud providers (AWS, AZURE, GCP, Openstack etc.)
8) To automate infrastructure creation we will use Terraform.

### Advantages of DevOps

1) Speed
2) Rapid development
3) Quick releases
4) Reliability
5) Security
6) Client satisfaction
7) Teams collaboration

## Meta-arguments and its use in Terraform.

Meta-arguments in Terraform are special configuration options that are not associated with any specific resource but provide instructions or configuration for how Terraform itself should behave. These meta-arguments are typically defined within a provider block or a terraform block in your Terraform configuration. They help you manage the behaviour of Terraform itself or configure the interaction with providers.

## Modules

Modules are containers for multiple resources that are used together. A module consists of a collection of .tf and/or .tf.json files kept together in a directory.
A module can call other modules, which lets you include the child module's resources into the configuration in a concise way.
Modules can also be called multiple times, either within the same configuration or in separate configurations, allowing resource configurations to be packaged and re-used.

# Terraform Variables

### Declare Variables

In your Terraform configuration files (typically with a .tf extension), you can declare variables using the `variable` block. 

variable.tf

```
variable "aws_region" {
  description = "The AWS region where resources will be created."
  default     = "us-east-1"
}

variable "instance_type" {
  description = "The type of EC2 instance to launch."
  default     = "t2.micro"
}
```

### Reference Variables

You can reference these variables in your resource blocks or other parts of your configuration using the `var` function.

```
provider "aws" {
  region = var.aws_region
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = var.instance_type
}

```

### Output Value

Terraform output variables allow you to expose specific information or values from your infrastructure deployment for use outside of your Terraform configuration. In your Terraform configuration, you can define output variables using the `output` block. 

```
output "instance_ip" {
  description = "The public IP  of the EC2 instance."
  value       = aws_instance.example.public_ip
}
```

### Example:

variable.tf
```
variable "ami1" {
    description = "amazon machine image"
    type = string
    default = "ami-0f5ee92e2d63afc18"
}

variable "instance_type1" {
    description = "ec2 instance type"
    type = string
    default = "t2.micro"
}

variable "instance_count" {
    description = "subnet for instance"
    type = number
    default = 2
}
```

main.tf

```
//Using variables Deploying EC2. 

//Deploying Ec2 Instance

resource "aws_instance" "my_public_instance" {
  ami           = var.ami1
  count         = var.instance_count
  instance_type = var.instance_type1
  key_name      = "mydemokey"
  vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.server_security_group.id]
  user_data = "${file("user_data1.sh")}"
  tags = {
    Name = "EC2_Instance-${count.index}"
  }
}

// Define an output variable to expose the public IP address of the EC2 instance

output "public_ip" {
  description = "Public IP of the EC2 instance"
  value       = aws_instance.my_public_instance.public_ip
}

//Deploying Ec2 instance Security group

resource "aws_security_group" "server_security_group" {
  name        = "EC2_server_security_group1"
  description = "enabled ssh and http ports"

  ingress {
    from_port   = 80
    to_port     = 80
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  ingress {
    from_port   = 22
    to_port     = 22
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  egress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
    
  tags = {
    Name = "EC2_SG"
  }
}
```
## Terraform tfvars

Terraform `.tfvars` files, also known as variable definition files or variable files, are used to provide input values for Terraform variables. These files allow you to specify values for variables in a structured and reusable manner. `.tfvars` files are commonly used to separate variable values from the main Terraform configuration, making it easier to manage configurations for different environments or scenarios.

1) Create a `.tfvars` File
Name this file according to your preference, but it's common to name it something like variables.tfvars, dev.tfvars, prod.tfvars, etc., to indicate its purpose or environment.

variable.tfvars
```
aws_region = "us-west-2"
instance_type = "t2.micro"
```

When running Terraform commands like terraform apply or terraform plan, you can specify the `.tfvars` file using the `-var-file`
```
terraform apply -var-file=variables.tfvars
```

If you name your `.tfvars` file according to a specific pattern (e.g., terraform.tfvars or *.auto.tfvars), Terraform will automatically load it without needing to specify it with `-var-file`.

## Conditional Expressions
Conditional expressions in Terraform are used to define conditional logic within your configurations. They allow you to make decisions or set values based on conditions. Conditional expressions are typically used to control whether resources are created or configured based on the evaluation of a condition.

The basic structure of a conditional expression is

```
condition ? expression_if_true : expression_if_false
```
The `condition` is evaluated first. If it's true, the value of `expression_if_true` is returned; otherwise, the value of `expression_if_false` is returned.

### Example:
```
variable "environment" {
  description = "Environment"
  type        = string
  default     = "development"
}

variable "production_subnet_cidr" {
  description = "CIDR block for production subnet"
  type        = string
  default     = "10.0.1.0/24"
}

variable "development_subnet_cidr" {
  description = "CIDR block for development subnet"
  type        = string
  default     = "10.0.2.0/24"
}

resource "aws_security_group" "my-SG" {
  name        = "my-sg"
  description = "my security group"

  ingress {
    from_port   = 22
    to_port     = 22
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = var.environment == "production" ? [var.production_subnet_cidr] : [var.development_subnet_cidr]
  }
}
```

# Modules

Modules are containers for multiple resources that are used together. A module consists of a collection of `.tf` files kept together in a directory. A module can call other modules, which lets you include the child module's resources into the configuration in a concise way. Modules can also be called multiple times, either within the same configuration or in separate configurations, allowing resource configurations to be packaged and re-used. 

Module Inputs (Variables):

1) Modules can have input variables that allow users to customize the behavior of the module.
2) Input variables are defined using the variable block in the module's configuration.
3) Users of the module provide values for these variables when they call the module.

Module Outputs:

1) Modules can define output values that allow users to access information or results from the module.
2) Output values are defined using the output block in the module's configuration.

```
variable "ami" {
  description = "The AMI ID for the EC2 instance"
}

// main.tf (inside the module directory)

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = var.ami
  instance_type = var.instance_type
}

variable "instance_type" {
  description = "The instance type for the EC2 instance"
}

output "instance_id" {
  description = "The ID of the created EC2 instance"
  value       = aws_instance.example.id
}
```
